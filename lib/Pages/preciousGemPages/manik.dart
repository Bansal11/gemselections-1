It is said to prolong life and control the three vital elements Vays (air), Pitta (fire and Kapha (water). A number of diseases like Tuberculosis, Pains, Boils, Ulcers, Eye Troubles, Constipation, Effects of Poisons can be cured by it. The burning sensation in the stomach and the limbs can also be cured by it.\n\nHeart diseases, mental problems, problems of the bones, headaches, loss of glow in skin, loss of appetite and indigestion can also be cured by the Red Cosmic Rays of the Ruby.\n\nThe basic chakra or the mooldhara chakra contains a lot of Red energy in all living beings especially humans. The quantity of red colour determines the energy level of the person. If the basic chakra is depleted of the red energy due to any reason then the person has number of problems â€“ like weakness, lack of heat in the body, circulation of blood is disturbed, the healing of injuries take a longer time to get alright and the body is unable to fight the attacks from bacteria and the person gets sick again and again.\n\nAll the major chakras, when seen Clairevoyantly, have some red colour in them. Thus, the wearing of Ruby which transfers a lot of red cosmic energy into our system helps strengthening all the major chakras of the body.Where bones are brittle or fractures are not healing this can be an effective remedy.\n\nAstrological Relevance of the Ruby Gemstone Ruby Gemstone is the Gem of Star Sun and is used to empower it. It is has some general benefits which include"),
